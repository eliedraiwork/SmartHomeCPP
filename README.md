# SmartHomeCPP
Describe a smart home with autonomous running sensors and controllers.

## Brief project description
A building is known as *smart* when it has the ability to collect data from environmental sensors combined with the possibility to make decisions based on that data.
Our goal is to build a platform which will provide access, and management of this hardware.
